Overview
Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) cause 2-5¬∞C temperature increases in dense urban cores, 15-20% higher energy consumption, and disproportionate health impacts on vulnerable populations. Our UHI Mitigation Planner provides a data-driven solution that:

Identifies heat vulnerability zones using multi-satellite data fusion
Models the effectiveness of nature-based and technological interventions
Generates actionable, cost-optimized recommendations for urban planners
Projects long-term climate resilience impacts
Problem Statement
Cities worldwide face escalating UHI effects due to:

Loss of vegetation and green spaces
Heat-absorbing building materials and infrastructure
Waste heat from energy systems and transportation
Amplifying effects of climate change
Existing solutions are limited by siloed data sources, a lack of predictive modeling, an inability to optimize interventions, and poor accessibility for non-technical stakeholders.

Solution Approach
Our platform integrates:

Multi-Satellite Data Fusion: Combines Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and MODIS data for comprehensive thermal monitoring
AI-Powered Analysis: Machine learning models to predict UHI formation and intervention effectiveness
Generative Recommendations: AI-driven solution generation tailored to urban contexts
Interactive Visualization: Intuitive interfaces for planners and policymakers
Technical Innovation
Novel Data Fusion Pipeline: Integrates MODIS temporal data with high-resolution Landsat/Sentinel imagery
Optimization Engine: Multi-objective optimization balancing cost, effectiveness, and co-benefits
Generative Design: AI-generated urban intervention proposals with expected outcomes
Key Components
Data Ingestion Engine: Automated downloading and preprocessing of satellite data
Visualization Dashboard: Streamlit-based interactive interface
Modeling and Predictive Analysis: Advanced algorithms for UHI mitigation planning
Case Studies
Pune
Identified: 18 critical hotspots with temperatures 2-3¬∞C above the surroundings
Recommended: Green corridors, reflective roofing, urban forests
Projected Impact: 2.5-3.0¬∞C temperature reduction
Cost-Benefit: 3.2x return on investment
Nashik
Identified: 12 critical hotspots with temperatures 1-2¬∞C above surroundings
Recommended: Green infrastructure, cool pavements, water-sensitive urban design
Projected Impact: 2.0-2.8¬∞C temperature reduction
Cost-Benefit: 2.8x return on investment
